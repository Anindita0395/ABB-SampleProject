# ABB-SampleProject
This is to store code for DevOps Scenario based questions for ABB

I have divided it into 2 folders - **Containerization** and **Terraform-Modules**

In the each of the folder I have tried showcasing the following concepts either in the YAML Pipeline or with the help of a readme file :

### *Containerization*

*Readme Files*
- Brief description (containerization-overview.md)
- Branching and Workflow (branching-strategy.md)
- Pipeline Debugging (pipeline-debugging.md)
- Kubernetes Networking Issue (network-issue-resolved.md)

*Azure Yaml Pipeline*
- CI Pipeline
- CD Pipeline
- Multi-Stage Pipeline
- Secrets Management
- Dockerizing Applications
- Kubernetes Deployment
- Helm Chart

### *Terraform-Modules*
- Brief description (terraform-modules-overview.md)
- Terraform deployment of VNET, KEYVAULT, ACR and AKS.
